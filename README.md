***React Price Card Task***



Here I have created Price card task with react.js on vite tool dynamically.
Hee I have created filename called CompA.jsx inwhich the parameters of arrObj are accessed from App.jxs from where the arrObj has been passed.

Used filenames:

  1. App.jsx --- arrObj has been declared and passed to CompA.jsx

  2. CompA.jsx(src/Componant/CompA.jsx)--arrObj has been accessed and utilized using map method.Also I have  used some svg files here.

  3. index.html--bootstrap link have been used here

  4. main.jsx
